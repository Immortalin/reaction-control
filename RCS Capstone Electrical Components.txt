RCS Capstone Electrical Components

Pressure transducer 
– spec sheet in Appendix A  
Quantity = 1
Manufacturer Ashcroft
Part# G2 M01 15 F2 5000# 
input voltage: 9-36Vdc
output voltage: 1-5Vdc
supply current 4: mA
Purpose
The pressure transducer will be used to measure remaining mass of N2 during flight for delta v calculations.
Time Sampling 
Sample rate should be no less than 10 Hz
Data Transferred
The pressure transducer will output a voltage that needs to be interpreted as the pressure remaining in the tank



Connections
There are four wires inside a shielded cable.  Red and Black are for input voltage and White and grey for output.	
System Location
The pressure transducer is located at the nozzle of the gas tank and has a 2 ft cable.






Solenoids 
– spec sheet in Appendix B
Quantity: 6
Model# 320
Manufacturer: Humprey
Electrical Specs
Voltage: 24V DC w/ range of +10% and -15%
Resistance: 72 Ohms
Current: 333mA
Power Consumption: 8 W max draw 
Response time: on - 0.018 s, off - 0.009 s




Purpose
The solenoids will be actuated to a given range of duty cycle by the rocket’s computer using a control algorithm. 
Temperatures
Ambient temperature range: 32 F to 125 F
Connections
There are two 24 in black lead wires 18 AWG.
Humphry spec sheet on the 3rd page mentions two different connectors that can be ordered.
